{"name":"Musly","tagline":"Musly - Music Similarity Library","body":"# Under development #\r\n\r\nMusly is still under development. Please do not report any issues yet.\r\nExpect Version 0.1 in January 2014.\r\n\r\nMusly\r\n=====\r\n\r\n(c) 2013-2014, Dominik Schnitzer <dominik@schnitzer.at>\r\n\r\nMusly is a program and library for high performance audio music similarity\r\ncomputation. Musly only uses the audio signal when computing similarities!\r\nNo meta data is used in the similarity computation process.\r\n\r\nThe source code is released under the MPL 2.0 see the file <musly/COPYING>\r\n\r\n* The main Musly website is located at: <http://www.musly.org>\r\n* Please fork me at: <https://github.com/dominikschnitzer/musly>\r\n* Please report any Musly bug at:\r\n  <https://github.com/dominikschnitzer/musly/issues>\r\n* Documentation is found in the local <musly/doc> directory and on the main\r\n  website.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version History ##\r\n\r\n### VERSION 0.1 ###\r\n\r\nThe first public Musly release. It includes two basic audio music similarity\r\nmeasures:\r\n\r\n-   *mandelellis* (as published in \"M. Mandel and D. Ellis: Song-level\r\n    features and support vector machines for music classification. In the\r\n    proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Music Information Retrieval,\r\n    ISMIR, 2005)\r\n    \r\n-   *timbre* the mandelellis similarity measure tweaked for best\r\n    results. We use a 25 MFCCs representation, the Jensen-Shannon divergence\r\n    and normalize the similarities with Mutual Proximity\r\n    (D. Schnitzer et al.: Using mutual proximity to improve\r\n    content-based audio similarity. In the proceedings of the 12th\r\n    International Society for Music Information Retrieval\r\n    Conference, ISMIR, 2011).\r\n\r\nFor benchmarks and qualitative comparisons between other audio music\r\nsimilarity measures visit <http://www.musly.org>.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Command Line Tool ##\r\n\r\nThe command line interface is able to:\r\n\r\n* Generate M3U playlists for music collections.\r\n* Output full similarity matrices for more in-depth research of the\r\n  audio music similarity functions. It uses the music-ir.org MIREX format\r\n  (see <musly/doc/MIREX-DistanceMatrix.md>)\r\n* Additionally the music similarity features can be ouput in text format\r\n  to ease reuse of the features.\r\n  \r\nThe command line tool is called \"musly\". Use \"musly -h\" to read about all\r\navailable options.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Library ##\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Development ##\r\n\r\nTo help Musly development and fix bugs the most convenient way is to use\r\nEclipse. To generate an Eclipse project use:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmake -G\"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles\" -DCMAKE_ECLIPSE_EXECUTABLE=/path/to/eclipse/eclipse /path/to/musly-src\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom an empty directory. The directory is filled with Eclipse project\r\ninformation which can be imported as an Eclipse project.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
